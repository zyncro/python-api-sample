Python Api Example
==================

This example shows how to use the Zyncro REST API from Python.

We use [python-oauth2](https://github.com/simplegeo/python-oauth2 "python-oauth2") as the OAuth client library.

`ZyncroApiSample.py` shows how to get a validated Access Token and invoke two API services. One to get the microblogging and another to post a new message.

In a real world app you can store the Access Token and reuse it.
